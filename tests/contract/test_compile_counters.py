"""The CPU counters of the hot entry points never grow (decision record 0011, principle 5.8).

``benchmarks/run.py --counters-only`` measures on CPU, for every counter row its docstring lists, the graph breaks,
recompiles, top-level operators and host-syncing operators, and compares them with
``benchmarks/thresholds/torch-<version>.json``. It exits 1 when a counter is above its threshold, a row has no
threshold, or the installed torch has no thresholds file. It runs in a child process with the internal checks off:
they add host syncs and operators, and the switch is read once, at import. Marked ``slow`` (about a minute).
