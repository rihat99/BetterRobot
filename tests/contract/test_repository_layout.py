"""The repository's tree: its top-level entries, a tests folder per src package, no tracked symlink or large file, no
ghost directory (principles 9.1, 9.2, 9.3, 9.6; record 0039).

Each kind of file has one home, so a second home fails here. A tracked symlink over an ignored directory replaces
that directory on checkout, and a large file weighs on every clone forever: a file that truly cannot shrink goes in
``LARGE_ON_PURPOSE`` with its reason. A directory with no tracked file in it (only ``__pycache__`` or stale output)
looks like a package to ``ls`` and ``grep``.
