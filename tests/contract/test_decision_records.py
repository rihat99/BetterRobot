"""Every decision record follows the template, carries an allowed status and an index row, and keeps its text (8.2).

A record is a file ``NNNN-kebab-title.md`` in the decisions folder; the numbers run from 0001 without a gap. Its
Status line is, in full, ``**Status:** WORD[ (WHO)][; amended by NNNN, ...][; amendment proposed in NNNN, ...]``
then ``.`` or `` ·`` and the ``**Date:**``: WORD is ``Proposed``, ``Accepted`` or ``Superseded by NNNN``, WHO is
``owner``, ``integrator, awaiting owner`` or ``integrator ruling R-n, YYYY-MM-DD``, and every number it points at is a
later record: one that amends is not Proposed, one that proposes an amendment is. Accepted
is the owner's word (principle 8.2): a record whose status was owner-accepted or superseded in any commit (no
``integrator`` in it) never returns to Proposed and keeps the text of that first commit, Status line aside. A record
accepted now keeps the text it had when its current acceptance began (the first commit after its last Proposed
one), Status line aside: a change is a new record. A record the integrator accepted may go back to Proposed for the
owner's review, so it was never frozen by the owner. Records 0001 to 0008 predate the template and the frozen-text
rule, so they sit in the permanent exception list below; the resolver test (``tests/contract/test_citations.py``)
checks the paths every record cites.
