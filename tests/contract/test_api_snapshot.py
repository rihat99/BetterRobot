"""The public API equals its snapshot, ``tests/contract/public_api.json`` (decision record 0024).

Every path of the ``__all__`` tree with its kind and signature (``better_robot.testing.public_api``) is tracked, so
a change to the public surface is a reviewed edit of the snapshot, never a side effect. After an intended change:
``uv run python tools/api_snapshot.py --check`` lists it, ``--write`` records it, and the changelog says it.
